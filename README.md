# cost-modeling-of-order-method-adjustment
This project demonstrates the use of SQL in calculating and comparing the total costs incurred from varying order methods. This general analysis method was used to determine the lowest cost ordering method available and project its cost savings. To allow this cost modeling method to be easily understood and adpated to new situations by others, I've created example data sets in this repo. These example data sets represent data that would be used for this model. However, this example data does not reflect data from my company or our customers that may be interpretted as sensitive or confidential. This includes but is not limited to - sales data and pricing. Decriptive comments are included in the SQL code explaining methods and calculations.
